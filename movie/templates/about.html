            <p class="lead">Welcome to our movie review platform, a project developed for the Web Development course at EAFIT University. This application is a practical exercise in building a web system using Django, where we explore how to create a dynamic, database-driven site.</p>
            <p>Our platform allows users to search for movies, view details, and read reviews. It is designed to be a simple yet powerful tool for movie enthusiasts who want to discover new films and share their opinions with a community of like-minded individuals.</p>
